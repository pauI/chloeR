map.window(input_raster, metrics, output_csv = NULL, properties_file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_raster}{String. Path to the input raster dataset(s), with multiple paths separated by commas.}

\item{metrics}{Vector of strings. Names of the landscape metrics to calculate over the map extent.}

\item{output_csv}{String (optional). File name for the CSV file with calculated metrics. If NULL, no CSV is created.}

\description{
Applies a map-wide analysis to raster datasets, calculating specified landscape metrics
over the entire extent without moving windows. Results are exported as CSV tables.

\examples{
map.window(
  input_raster = system.file("data/sample.tif", package = "chloe"),
  metrics = c("SHDI", "HET"),
  output_csv = "map_metrics.csv"
)
